## About the Video Course
With the increasing demand for responsive and interactive interfaces from web users, the animation plays a crucial role. SVG is changing the way we design the user experience for the web. SVG is lightweight, can be used with CSS and JavaScript, has XML functionality and makes the most beautiful designs and even small interactive games. This leading language encompasses XML, JavaScript PHP among others all-in-one shell. The potential with SVG is galore and we have just begun.

This course offers a strong foundation within the SVG world, showcasing its unique potential. You will learn many cool techniques of web animations. Web animation is a fairly tricky subject; however, we offer to help you understand and explore its potential in a simple and easy manner. We start with showcasing the basic structures of using an SVG within an HTML and CSS environment and continue to explore the possibilities of the robust language. 

By the end of the course, you will be able to customize animations for your web applications using different methods. This course will give you an in-depth understanding of SVG. We have made it a point that you have all the tools required for your exploration of any SVG project.
